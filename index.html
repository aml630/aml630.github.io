            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p>From 2006 to 2011 I played online poker professionally as I
               finished up high school and started my undergraduate degree in busineess-finance.
               After 2011 I went back to school at Portland State University and finished that
               undergraduate degree.  In 2014 I passed my level 1 (of 3) test in order
               to become a Chartered Financial Analyst.  During that year I became very interested
               in web applications and found myself studying web marketing and web development with all
               my free time.  This led me to join Epicodus during January of 2016.
